# fprime-fsecond-iteration

f1-f2-iteration.py is the section of script that is relevant. I have included the data_processing.py file which is the entire script as it stands. The .txt files are necessary to import if you want to use f1-f2-iteration.py.
A note: for some reason the 'i' in my lambda function doesn't work when using f1-f2-iteration.py, but it does if you run the whole data_processing.py script (which is considerably slower).
